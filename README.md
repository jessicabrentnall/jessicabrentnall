## Hi! I'm Jessica ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Distinguished Architect / Head of Architecture at NewDay. Also a [Microsoft MVP in Developer Technologies](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003572), an international speaker and a mentor. I was also an elected member of the .NET Foundations Board of Directors (2022 - 2024) and Chair of the [.NET Foundation Membership Committee](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-membership#readme) (2022 - 2024).

I'm the co-organiser and co-founder of [DDD East Midlands Conference](https://dddeastmidlands.com/). Sadly, no future owner could be found to take over DDD East Midlands, so we are in the process of tearing down the company. I manage the repositories for this event and the .NET NOtts meetup. 

I love a good cup of coffee as much as I love a good book. Happy to chat over a coffee about tech, the universe and everything.
