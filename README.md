## Hi! I'm Jessica ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Principal Architect, a [Microsoft MVP in Developer Technologies](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003572), an international speaker and a mentor. I am also an elected member of the [.NET Foundations Board of Directors](https://dotnetfoundation.org/about/board-of-directors) and Chair of the [.NET Foundation Membership Committee](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-membership#readme).

I'm the co-organiser and co-founder of [DDD East Midlands Conference](https://dddeastmidlands.com/) and co-organiser of the [.NET Notts meetups](https://github.com/dotnetnotts) and manage their repositories. Both are open source and have plenty of issue for you to pick up, so please do get involved and contribute to them. I also am a co-organiser of the [The Tech Community wellbeing check-in](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterrising/overlay/1635520873182/single-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAAADQhTcBpCdlYgEIjedweLcsqgzb8jiiDvE).

I love a good cup of coffee as much as I love a good book. Happy to chat over a coffee about tech, the universe and everything.
